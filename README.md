# Commerce-Instamojo
Google Summer Of Code 2018

The project is to port the Commerce Instamojo module and all its features from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. This module allows the user to do payments instantly by creating a link. While porting its features the Form API is used to create various forms for collecting details of customers and payment requests. After this project Drupal 8 will have a working Commerce Instamojo module through Drupal Commerce. And finally will have a module which can be downloaded through Administrative Interface, GitHub, and composer.
